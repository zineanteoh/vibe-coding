# Vibe Coding

Weekly hour-ish coding projects 🎨 Built with **AI only** — no human coding allowed (even when we want to).

Every week, [@kohrachel](https://github.com/kohrachel) and I give ourselves **1 hour** to build something weird, fun, or just plain chaotic using only AI tools. The goal? **Creativity over polish**, and **learning through limits**.
